# CMLMusicPlayer

This is just a small music player for cmd under .NET framework 4.5+. If you are a `Linux` or `Mac OS` user, install `mono`.

This application is based on the library [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).

## 1 How to use

Use `.\CMLMusicPlayer -h` for help.

Use `.\CMLMusicPlayer [path]` to play musics (.mp3, .wav, etc) in the specific `path`(which is a folder!).

	- If `path` is not specified, the default path is `Musics` folder under the current folder where the executable is.
